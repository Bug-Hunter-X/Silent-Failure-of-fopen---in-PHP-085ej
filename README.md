# Silent fopen() Failure in PHP

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in PHP: the silent failure of the `fopen()` function. When `fopen()` encounters an error (e.g., the file doesn't exist, insufficient permissions), it can return `false` without raising an error.  This can lead to unexpected behavior in your application because the code that processes the file might not execute, leading to hard-to-find bugs.

The `bug.php` file showcases this problem; `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected version demonstrating proper error handling.
